We would like to point out the differences with the first submitted
version, and why we think that these differences address the remarks of
the anonymous reviewers.

Since this article was written as a collaboration using the GitHub
platform, in case the reviewers neede a full set of differences between
both versions, this is available with the two following commands:

git clone https://github.com/Hugounenq-Cyril/Two_curves_on_a_volcano
git diff ANTS_submission explicit-isogenies.tex

The most important changes we made are the following:

 - We replaced the incorrect assumption ℓ=O(1) by a worst-case bound
   which we computed as ℓ=O(log q), and updated the complexities of
   Proposition 5.1 and the Theorem accordingly.

 - We precised which steps in the algorithms use randomness.

 - We restated our original complexity claim as a median-case value, and
   explained why we think that this is useful in practice.

 - We expanded a bit the numerical range of our experiments, using
   parameters up to usual cryptographic sizes.
